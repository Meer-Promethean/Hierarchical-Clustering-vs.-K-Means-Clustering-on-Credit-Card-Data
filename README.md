# Hierarchical Clustering vs. K-Means Clustering on Credit Card Data

## Objective
In this assignment, you will use the provided credit card dataset to compare **Hierarchical Clustering** and **K-Means Clustering** for customer segmentation. You will evaluate their performance, compare the cluster structures, and analyze the differences in the results.

## Dataset
Download the dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata).

## Tasks

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
- Handle any missing or inconsistent values.
- Normalize/scale the numerical features to ensure uniformity.
- If necessary, drop or encode categorical variables.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate summary statistics of the dataset.
- Visualize distributions of key features.
- Perform pairwise scatter plots or correlation analysis to identify feature relationships.

### 3. Hierarchical Clustering
- Perform **Hierarchical Clustering** on the dataset.
  - Use the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` library or other relevant tools.
  - Compute a dendrogram to visualize the clustering hierarchy.
  - Choose the optimal number of clusters by cutting the dendrogram at the appropriate height.
- Assign cluster labels to the data.

### 4. K-Means Clustering
- Perform **K-Means Clustering** on the same dataset.
  - Train the K-Means model and assign cluster labels to the data.
- Visualize the clusters using the same approach as in Hierarchical Clustering.

### 5. Compare Results
- Compare the clusters generated by both methods:
  - Check the number of data points in each cluster for both approaches.
  - Compare the centroids (or cluster centers) of K-Means clusters to the characteristics of Hierarchical clusters.
  - Analyze if similar groups are formed by both methods.
